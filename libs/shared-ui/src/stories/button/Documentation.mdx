import { Canvas, Controls, Meta, Subtitle, Title } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';
import * as ButtonStories from './button.stories';

<Meta of={ButtonStories} />

<Title>Button</Title>
<Subtitle>A button is the primary way to interact with the platform.</Subtitle>

Below you can find the most basic implementation:

#### Default

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Default} />
<Controls of={ButtonStories.Default} />

More examples below:

#### Disabled

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

#### Processing

The processing state can be dynamically set. The button size will remain the same whether the label is showing or the spinner icon. When the processing state is shown, the button will also be disabled to prevent more triggers.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Processing} />

#### Primary

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

#### Dangerous

A state of `danger` should be used when the button has destructive results, like removing an account, or other kind of data.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Dangerous} />

#### With a leading icon

You can insert an icon in front of the button's label like so:

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.WithLeadingIcon} />

Do keep in mind that the button is not responsive enough to dynamically insert or remove an icon, causing text to overflow when a icon is inserted into a button which previously had none.
