## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A placeholder page titled D&D Mapp, in a dark theme.
- The `dndmapp/web` Docker image, which serves the app with nginx on port 4200.
- The `BASE_HREF` build argument of the image, which serves the app under a base path, such as `/pr-42/`.
- `build-info.json`, which reports the commit and version of the build that a deployment serves.
- A `/healthz` endpoint and a `HEALTHCHECK` in the image, which report whether the container is healthy.
