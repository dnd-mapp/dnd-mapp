Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is [[PHB - Chapter 8 - Adventuring#Vision and Light|heavily obscured]], and exposed flames in the area are doused.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it [[PHB - Chapter 9 - Combat#Difficult Terrain|difficult terrain]]. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls [[prone]].

If a creature starts its turn in the spell's area and is concentrating on a spell, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.
